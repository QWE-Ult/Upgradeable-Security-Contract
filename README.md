# Upgradeable-Security-Contract
A reusable, upgradable base contract built on OpenZeppelin’s upgradeable libraries. It provides out-of-the-box role-based access control, pausing, reentrancy guards, whitelist/blacklist management, emergency withdrawal modes, and UUPS upgradeability hooks—so you can inherit and focus only on your custom business logic.
